# SQLAlchemy-Challenge

As a part of this research project,  I was required to analyse the climate dataset (hawaii.sqlite) for Honolulu, Hawaii! a favourable destination for most travellers; owing to its spelendid natural beauty. 

Is travelling to Honolulu enjoyable throughout the year? Hmmmmm.....lets find out!

##Part 1: Climate Analysis and Exploration
Employing SQLAlchemy ORM queries, Pandas, and Matplotlib, I carried out climate analysis and data exploration of the climate database. IN order to complete this task i connected to SQLite database (by a creating engine), followed by automap_base() to reflect weather tables into classes and finally connecting to python using a SQLAlchemy session.


### Precipitation Analysis
Precipitation data was analysed for the last 1 year of the climate dataset to get an idea of the most (recent) annual precipation pattern.
